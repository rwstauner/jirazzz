# jirazzz

A jira rest client command line app written as a [babashka][babashka] script.

Designed for configurability, to be usable with any jira instance.

## Authentication

### OAuth token

Jira Cloud: Go to https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens and create a new token. Then put its base64-encoded value in the config (see below).

### Cookie

Maybe you can't configure cli authentication, or don't want to use basic auth...
Just visit jira in your browser and steal
your own cookie (see "Example Config" below).

## Installation

Install Babashka. Then, Inside a directory that is on your path, such as `/usr/local/bin`:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rwstauner/jirazzz/main/jirazzz
chmod u+x jirazzz
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rwstauner/jirazzz/main/example-config.edn -O ~/.jirazzz.edn
```

Finally, adjust `~/.jirazzz.edn` as necessary.

## Configuration

The default file is `~/.jirazzz.edn`.
An alternate can be specified with env var `JIRAZZZ_CONFIG_FILE`.

<!-- { jirazzz example-config -->

```clojure
{
 ; URL prefix of your jira instance.
 :url "https://jira.example.com"
 ; Any headers you want to add to requests (useful for auth).
 :headers {"Cookie" #file ".cookie.txt"}
 ; or, with an oauth token:
 ;:headers {"Authorization" "Basic <base64-encoded-token-value>"}
 ; The rapid-view / sprint board id.
 :rapid-view 123
 ; Project key.
 :project "ABC"
 ; Jira username (might be something like "flastname").
 :assignee #env USER
 ; Type of issue to create.
 :issue-type "Task"
 ; Pattern to look for in commit messages.  Should have single capture group.
 :issue-pattern "\\[([A-Z]+-[0-9]+)\\]"
 ; A selmer template for how to add issue to commit messages.
 :commit-template "[{{issue}}] {{summary}}\n\n{{description}}"
 ; Transition issue to this state.
 :transition "ready for review"
 ; Pattern to match against sprint names when looking for current (first ACTIVE) sprint.
 :sprint-pattern "."
 ; Values for defined custom fields.
 :storypoints 1
 ; Aliases for custom fields so they are recognized by config/arguments.
 :custom-fields
 {
  ; Sprint-id will be filled in with "current sprint".
  :sprint-id   :customfield_12345
  ; Other fields can be specified on the command line or in config.
  :storypoints :customfield_10001
 }
 :aliases
 {example-alias {:doc "Custom alias command"
                 :args ["search" "--jql" "project = ABC AND statusCategory IN (â€¦)"]}}
}
```

<!-- jirazzz example-config } -->

Most fields in the config file can be overridden via command line arguments
(see usage output).

Available readers:
- `#env` - Substitute an environment variable
- `#file` - Read file (relative to config file directory)

Need to figure out your custom fields?

Look at the json output for an existing issue
by inspecting the response in your browser, or use jirazzz:

    jirazzz issue ABC-123


## Pronunciation

It's a combination of "jira" and "ðŸ’¤" (it's a "rest" client).
I call it "jira Z's".
